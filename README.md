# Audio Dataset Labelling Automation
This project aims to streamline the dataset creation and labelling processes for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems.
Project consists of 3 parts.
<ul>
<li>AudioFile Ingestion</li>
<li>Automatic Labelling with ASR (Whisper Model)</li>
<li>Manual Labelling for improved dataset quality</li>
</ul>

WebRTC-VAD implementation is taken from this repository.
